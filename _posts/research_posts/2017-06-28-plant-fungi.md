Constructing a stable, beneficial, and functional complementary microbial community is of importance in many aspects of life. It can be applied in fields such as human gut microbiome, agricultural application, and environmental restoration. 

We are investigating interactions between plants and their fungal symbionts under varied environmental and biological conditions. We seek to use the obtained data to construct a quantifiable system allowing us to manipulate microbial communities suitable for conditions where to be applied.

We are using plant Arabidopsis thaliana and combinations of three proven beneficial fungal endophytes to study their interactions under nutrient sufficient/deficient conditions in different plant developing stages.
