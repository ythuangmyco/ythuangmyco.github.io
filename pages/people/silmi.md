I am Silmi Yusri Rahmadani, a PhD candidate whose research in microbial ecology focuses on decoding the hidden dynamics of microbiomes using environmental DNA. I employ integrated 16S and ITS amplicon-based metagenomics to investigate the structure, function, and response of microbial communities to environmental changes.

### Research Interests
<hr>
Microbiology, Microbial ecology, Microbiome

### Education
<hr>
2022-present&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**PhD student**, Life Science, Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan
2011–2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**MSc**, Biology, Andalas University, Indonesia
2007–2011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**BSc**, Biology, Andalas University, Indonesia

### Executing Projects
<hr>
1. **Orchard-Type Soil Microbiome, Candida tropicalis, and Azole Residues**
Investigating how different orchard systems, ecological distribution of Candida tropicalis,  and azole fungicide residues shape soil bacterial and fungal communities using 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing.<br>
2. **Land Use, Edaphic Gradients, and Human Footprint Effects on Soil Microbiomes**
Analyzing how land-use categories, soil physicochemical properties, and anthropogenic disturbance collectively influence soil microbial diversity, community composition, and core microbiome structure.
