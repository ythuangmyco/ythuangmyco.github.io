My name is Amira Ibrahim, an Assistant Lecturer at Assiut University specializing in mycology and a PhD student at Kaohsiung Medical University (KMU) in the field of Microbiology.
My academic journey is driven by a deep passion for uncovering the hidden roles of microorganisms in ecosystems—both as key decomposers of lignocellulosic biomass and as emerging opportunistic pathogens. My current work particularly focuses on discovering of genetic mutations responsible for antimicrobial resistance in certain species of fungi.
### Research Interests

### Executing Projects
<hr>
1. Azole-resistance mutations in Lomentospora and Scedosporium species: This project aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of antifungal resistance in emerging opportunistic fungi that cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients, with the goal of informing the development of alternative and more effective treatment strategies, including novel antifungal agents such as olorofim.<br>
